# Toy Shop 

A toy shop website that has been built with React, React Router Dom & used firebase for authentication purpose and It is a fall stack project from where anyone can add and delete product as his wish. At the same time, he can view details information about any product and buy very easily. 

## Mainly, It is a toy sale site for those who are seeking their desired products from home and buy from online without going to market.

Here a customer will get all types of toy products according to his need and he will be able to subscribe out newsletter for getting update.

## In this project, I have created five section in home page which are banner, gallery and shop category , newsletter and upcoming products.  

In a few categories, a button has been included for details information. Besides, in detailed page, he will be able to know about product description and if he want, he can buy any product according to his requirements without any pain.
